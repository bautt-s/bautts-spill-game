# Paint & Spill Game

Simple web browser game for having a quick good fun!
Game is inspired by Avojak's game for ElementaryOS. Its original repository can be found at [https://github.com/avojak/paint-spill](https://github.com/avojak/paint-spill)

## Playing the Game
Instructions are quite simple: the player can choose from three different levels of difficulty. They start from the top-left corner, and the objective is to fill the gameboard with only one color, in the least amount of moves possible. 

Icons for accessibility, dark mode and a quick explanation are included in the game window.
